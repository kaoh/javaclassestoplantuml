# Introduction

This library generates [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/class-diagram) class diagrams from Java classes.
The library in its current state was created for getting a data model presentation of entities or DTOs.

This is the first version and has the following limitations:

* No methods are included
* No generics on classes are considered
* Only the passed package is scanned and no outside package
* It might be nice to add documentation based on supplied sources
* it might be nice to support some stereotypes based on existing annotation
